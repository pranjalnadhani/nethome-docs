# Hacking the Internet of Things

## NetHome
NetHome is a **Home Appliances as a Service** based on the **Internet of Things** which intends to connect various types of home appliances under one control system, allowing seamless remote control, automation and maintenance of all kinds of devices.

NetHome has easy-to-use **JSON APIs**. All of the APIs are documented here.

### About the API

An API (Application programming interface) is a protocol intended to be used as an interface by software components to communicate with each other.

Our API supports many methods, so there should not be a problem coding some nice applications.

This repo consists of all the documentation on the NetHome API. Feel free to browse through them and if you face any issues, then [add them here](https://github.com/pranjalnadhani/nethome-docs/issues), and we will get it sorted as soon as we can!
